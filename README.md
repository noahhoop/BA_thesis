If you only want to run the main analysis (the rest is hard to run anyway because of the LLM, API and webscraping) download these files: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R04oXu6np9DwdLIrr-iDK78Dxk0qqGEM/view?usp=sharing
Add the downloaded data folder to the main folder.
Read the Master Script for descriptions on the single scripts.
Script 12 and 16 are the actual analysis.
