If you only want to run the main analysis (the rest is hard to run anyway because of the LLM, API and webscraping) download these files: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xla26n4H3VtglMcmasxV3UcDI4kAjDlt/view?usp=drive_link 
Add the downloaded data folder to the main folder.
Read the Master Script for descriptions on the single scripts.
Script 12 is the validation for the text analysis and scripts 13 and 17 are the actual analysis. You can run these scripts with the second data folder.
